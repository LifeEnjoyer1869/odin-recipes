This is my first ever actual project. 
It's going to be something about recipes, I don't really know for sure.
It's going to demonstrate very basic HTML code.
I knew a good amount of HTML and CSS before the odin project, but I never knew how to make it into an actual website up until now.
Wish me luck!
