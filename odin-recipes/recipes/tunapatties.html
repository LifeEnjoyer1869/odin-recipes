<h3>Delicious Tuna Patties</h3>
<p>
    Tuna patties are a popular seafood dish made from canned tuna, often mixed with breadcrumbs, egg, and <strong>seasonings</strong>, and formed into patties.
     They are then <em>pan-fried</em> or baked until crispy and golden brown, and can be served as a sandwich filling, on a salad, or as a main course.
      Tuna patties are a convenient and protein-rich alternative to traditional beef or chicken burgers, and can be flavored with various ingredients such as onions, <strong>garlic</strong>, and herbs to suit individual tastes.
