<h3>Delicious American Meat</h3>
<p>
    Meat is animal tissue that is <strong>consumed</strong> as food, primarily obtained from livestock such as cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens. 
    It can be cooked and prepared in various ways, including grilling, roasting, <em>satueing</em>, and braising, and is often served as a main course or used as an ingredient in many dishes.
     Meat is an important source of protein, vitamins, and minerals in a healthy diet, and is <em>rich</em> in flavor and texture.
